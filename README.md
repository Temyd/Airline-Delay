### People are still Patronising Southwest Airlines
WN (Southwest Airlines) is also the most patronised airline with 94,097 flights leading the next airline DL (Delta Air Lines) with 33,157 flights. From the previous insight it can be seen that WN (Southwest Airlines) has the most delayed flight, yet again we are getting to know they are those patronised. This leaves a user wondering what exactly is going, what is causing the delay, what are they doing to retain customers and probably get new ones. Futher research shows that Southwest, is one of the major airlines of the United States and the **World's largest low-cost carrier**. This gives an insight to why people still kept using them despite having a reputation of having delayed flights more than any airline.

Least Patronised is HA(Hawaiian Airlines) despite having the least delay, futher research showed people googling **Why is Hawaiian Airlines expensive** probably this is the reason why it's the least patronised
